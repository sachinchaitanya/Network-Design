Title: Scalable Network Infrastructure for a Growing SME

This network design aims to build a flexible and resilient infrastructure to support the operations of a small-medium enterprise (SME) across three key departments - Engineering, Sales, and Management.

The network will utilize a combination of layer 2 and layer 3 devices to enable effective connectivity and communication within and between departments. Individual subnets will provide appropriate segmentation by sub-department.

The Engineering department comprises 260 staff PCs and 40 production servers clustered in groups of five for load balancing and redundancy. This setup ensures high availability and evenly distributed customer loads.

The Sales department encompasses a range of users with differing needs - technical writers, customer service, office and traveling sales staff. The network will provide dedicated resources for each user type, along with a VPN server and service production unit for secure remote access.

The Management department consists of a small leadership team requiring dedicated PCs. Shared resources like printers and file servers will also be incorporated to enable collaboration.

This comprehensive network design aims to meet the current demands of the SME while also providing a flexible foundation for future growth and change. The infrastructure facilitates efficient operations and cross-departmental collaboration through its scalable segmented architecture tailored to each department's specific requirements.
